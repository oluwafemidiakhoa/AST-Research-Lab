2. **HuggingFace Team**: "Built sustainability-focused training tool - can we collaborate?"
3. **PyTorch Lightning**: "AST integration for Lightning users?"
4. **Weights & Biases**: "Energy tracking integration?"

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

I built Adaptive Sparse Training (AST), which reduces ML training energy by 60%
while maintaining accuracy. It's already used in [X] Kaggle competitions and has
[Y] HuggingFace models trained with it.

Would you be interested in [collaboration/feature/integration]?

Package: pypi.org/project/adaptive-sparse-training
Demo: huggingface.co/spaces/[your-space]

Best,
Oluwafemi

💡 What if I told you we're wasting 60% of compute during ML training?

After training 100+ models, I discovered that:
- 60-70% of training samples don't help
- A simple PI controller can identify them
- Skipping them saves massive energy with no accuracy loss

I built Adaptive Sparse Training (AST) to prove it:
✅ 61% energy savings on ImageNet
✅ Works with ANY PyTorch model
✅ 5 lines of code to integrate

🌍 If every ML team used this, we'd cut AI's carbon footprint by >50%
